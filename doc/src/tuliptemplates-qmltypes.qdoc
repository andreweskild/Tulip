    \title Tulip Templates QML Types
    \ingroup qmlmodules

    \brief Provides a set of non-visual templates for user interfaces.

    Tulip Templates provides a set of non-visual templates for creating user interfaces
    controls in QML using \l {Qt Quick}.

    For the sake of clarity and simplicity there is a one-to-one mapping between the
    types provided by the \c Tulip.Templates and \c Tulip.Controls imports.
    For each non-visual template type available in the \c Tulip.Templates import, a
    visual type by the same name exists in the \c Tulip.Controls import.

    Tulip Templates QML types can be imported into your application
    using the following import statement in your \c .qml file:

    \badcode
    import Tulip.Templates 1.0 as TulipTemplates
    \endcode

    \section1
    \generatelist {qmltypesbymodule Tulip.Templates}
    \noautolist
